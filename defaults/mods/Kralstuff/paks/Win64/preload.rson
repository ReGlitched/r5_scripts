// List of paks to preload. The preloading happens after all the core paks of
// the engine and SDK have been loaded, but before the first level pak is being
// loaded. The unloading happens after all the level paks have been unloaded,
// but before the core paks are being unloaded. The listed paks will be loaded
// in the same order as defined in the array, and unloaded in the reverse order.
